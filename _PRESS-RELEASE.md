# HackerHelpr #
  Simplifying your programming workflow by summarizing StackOverflow results 

## Summary ##
  Have you ever been frustrated by the number of StackOverflow threads you need to read through before you find your answer? HackerHelpr gives you the top StackOverflow questions and answers for your question in one place to save you time and energy when you have a programming question.

## Problem ##
  When I'm working on a programming project and I run into trouble, the first thing I do is Google whatever I want to find out. I'll look through the results for relevant StackOverflow answers, but there's a lot of unhelpful information. This often means clicking through to 5-10 pages in new tabs and spending a few minutes on each of these pages. Over the course of a project, this is a lot of wasted time.
